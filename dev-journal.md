Bookshelf adventures

A world where bookshelves can have adventures.

This is a chatbot game where you tell the computer what mini-game you want to play.
The computer keeps track of where you are in any game, and your overall scores.
Games:
1. Pong-based game
2. Frogger-based game
3. Kung-Fu game
4. Tank game
5. Book-collecting game

The chatbot understands all the commands from our old chatbot, such as repeat and the other adventure games like the Hiking game and The Batcave.
